company's internal engineering practice and lead in the creation of Neighborhoods.com.
In my day-to-day I oversee the engineering team, help to coordinate business needs into

Gorilla is an consultancy that provides design and technical implementations
with a focus on e-commerce. I joined Gorilla in 2010 as a developer focussed on PHP and
the Magento e-commerce platform in particular. After a year or so of successful
implementations, I grew into the role of technical architect, where I helped
translate client business needs into technical solutions for the development team to
implement. My final role at Gorilla was as Practice Director of the company's
Magento practice. In that role I managed the company's PHP team as well as
